# extract-selection package
An atom package that allows you to extract the selected text into a let or const statement.

## Customizations
* You can change how the new let/const statement will end (semicolon, space+semicolon, or nothing) in the package settings.
* You can change the capitalization style that will be applied to the name of the new declaration (camelCase, snake_case, etc.).
